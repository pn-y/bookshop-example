Company A has several book stores, each store have different amount of books in stock. Book is sold if the amount in stock equals to 0. Each book has a publisher.

You need to design JSON API to be able to:
1. Fetch list of stores which have available books from a particular publisher.
2. Mark list of books as sold for a particular shop.

Code should be tested. No UI, only JSON.
